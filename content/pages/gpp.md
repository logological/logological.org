Title: GPP

# GPP

GPP is a general-purpose preprocessor with customizable syntax, suitable
for a wide range of preprocessing tasks. Its independence from any one
programming language makes it much more versatile than the C
preprocessor (cpp), while its syntax is lighter and more flexible than
that of [GNU m4](https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/). There are built-in
macros for use with C/C++, LaTeX, HTML, XHTML, and Prolog files.

GPP is [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). It
is distributed under the terms of the [GNU Lesser General Public
Licence](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html).

Documentation
-------------

You can browse through the [online HTML
documentation](https://files.nothingisreal.com/software/gpp/gpp.html).

Note that the documentation itself is generated by GPP using an input
file with macros that can automatically produce HTML, LaTeX, or troff
(man page) output.  Studying this file (`gpp.pp` in the source) should
prove instructive, and manually running it through GPP can serve as a
basic test of the program's functionality.

Authors
-------

GPP was originally written by [Denis
Auroux](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~auroux/). Since version 2.12 it
has been maintained by [Tristan Miller](/).
