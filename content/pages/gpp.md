Title: GPP

# GPP

GPP is a general-purpose preprocessor with customizable syntax, suitable
for a wide range of preprocessing tasks. Its independence from any one
programming language makes it much more versatile than the C
preprocessor (cpp), while its syntax is lighter and more flexible than
that of [GNU m4](https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/). There are built-in
macros for use with C/C++, LaTeX, HTML, XHTML, and Prolog files.

GPP is [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). It
is distributed under the terms of the [GNU Lesser General Public
Licence](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html).

Downloading
-----------

The latest stable version of GPP is **2.27**, released on
2020-07-27. A list of changes from previous versions can be found in
the
[change log](https://files.nothingisreal.com/software/gpp/NEWS).

### Source code

You can download portable source packages for the current and previous
releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/logological/gpp/releases) or
[nothingisreal.com](https://files.nothingisreal.com/software/gpp/). These
include a portable installation script and installation instructions.

Alternatively, you can [browse, download, or clone the development
version on GitHub](https://github.com/logological/gpp/), though note
that if you do this you will need to manually set up the build system
using the GNU Autotools rather than using the end-user installation
instructions mentioned above.

### Ports and binary packages

Binary packages are available for several systems, including:

* [Debian GNU/Linux](http://packages.debian.org/gpp)
* [FreeBSD](http://www.freshports.org/textproc/gpp/)
* [macOS](https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/lang/gpp/Portfile)
* [openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/tools/)
* [Ubuntu](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=gpp)
* Fedora (via its package management tool, DNF)

Note that these packages are produced and hosted by third parties. The
GPP authors take no responsibility for them.

Documentation
-------------

You can browse through the [online HTML
documentation](https://files.nothingisreal.com/software/gpp/gpp.html).

Note that the documentation itself is generated by GPP using an input
file with macros that can automatically produce HTML, LaTeX, or troff
(man page) output.  Studying this file (`gpp.pp` in the source) should
prove instructive, and manually running it through GPP can serve as a
basic test of the program's functionality.
