Title: GPP

# GPP

GPP is a general-purpose preprocessor with customizable syntax, suitable
for a wide range of preprocessing tasks. Its independence from any one
programming language makes it much more versatile than the C
preprocessor (cpp), while its syntax is lighter and more flexible than
that of [GNU m4](https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/). There are built-in
macros for use with C/C++, LaTeX, HTML, XHTML, and Prolog files.

GPP is [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). It
is distributed under the terms of the [GNU Lesser General Public
Licence](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html).
