Title: sshrc-insight

# `sshrc-insight`

The `sshrc-insight` LaTeX class facilitates the preparation of funding
proposals for the Insight Grants program of Canada's Social Sciences
and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC).  It has the following key
features:

* Formats the proposal according to the SSHRC's specifications.

* Allows parts of the proposal to be compiled into separate PDFs to
attach to the appropriate places in the online application form.

* Alternatively, allows the proposal to be compiled into a single PDF
in order to facilitate the writing and pre-submission reviewing
process.

* Ensures that citation numbering remains consistent regardless
whether the proposal is compiled as separate PDFs or a single PDF.

* Provides character counts for long-answer form fields.

* Supports preparation of proposals in either English or French.

* Compatible with `pdflatex`, `xelatex`, and `lualatex`.
