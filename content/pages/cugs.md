# Commodore Users Group of Saskatchewan

<img src="{static}/images/CUGS_logo.png" style="float:right; width:

nonprofit organization comprised of Commodore 64 and 128 users
interested in sharing ideas, programs, knowledge, problems, and
solutions with each other. Membership benefits included access to an
extensive library of public domain and shareware software, a disk
backup service, and an electronic bulletin board system
(BBS). Meetings were held monthly in Regina. The group disbanded in
the mid-1990s.

*The Monitor*
-------------

CUGS published a monthly newsletter, the *Monitor*, which was
distributed to members and to other Commodore users groups in North
America. Past issues are currently available from **[the Commodore Users
Group of Saskatchewan section of The Internet
Archive](https://archive.org/details/cugs-archive)**.

If you have any further issues of the *Monitor* in electronic form,
please send them to me and I will add them to the online archive.

*The Keyboard, Kids, and Krud*
------------------------------

*The Keyboard, Kids, and Krud* is a 32-minute tutorial video in which
CUGS member Ken Danylczuk demonstrates how to disassemble and clean a
Commodore 64 keyboard. The video was shot at Miller Comprehensive High
School in Regina, Saskatchewan in 1992.
