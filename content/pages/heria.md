# `heria`

`heria` is a LaTeX class that facilitates the preparation of Research
and Innovation Action (RIA) and Innovation Action (IA) funding
proposals for the European Commission's Horizon Europe program.  The
class is a conversion of the official Part B template into LaTeX; it
preserves the formatting and most of the instructions of the original
version, and has the additional feature that tables (listing the
participants, work packages, deliverables, etc.) are programmatically
generated according to data supplied by the user.
