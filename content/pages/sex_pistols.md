# Sex Pistols impersonations

Back in August 1997, some friends and I got together and spontaneously
decided to record some [Sex Pistols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Pistols) covers.
True to the spirit of punk, none of us were particularly adept at
playing our respective instruments—in fact, I had never sung or played
bass in my life before. Anyway, some of my friends say I sound like
[Johnny Rotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Rotten), but I'll leave that up to
you to decide. Here are brief clips of the two songs we recorded, as
well as clips from the original Sex Pistols versions for comparison.
