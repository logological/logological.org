Title: Biblet

# Biblet

**Biblet** is a set of BibTeX bibliography styles (bst) which generate
XHTML from BibTeX databases. Unlike other BibTeX to XML/HTML converters,
Biblet is written entirely in the native BibTeX style language and
therefore works "out of the box" on any system that runs BibTeX.
Features include automatic conversion of LaTeX symbols to HTML or
Unicode entities; customizable graphical hyperlinks to PostScript, PDF,
DVI, LaTeX, and HTML resources; support for nonstandard but common
fields such as day, isbn, and abstract; hideable text blocks; and output
of the original BibTeX entry for sharing citations. Biblet's highly
structured XHTML output means that bibliography appearance to can be
drastically altered simply by specifying a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS),
or easily postprocessed with third-party XML, HTML, or text processing
tools.

Biblet has not yet been formally released. However, a [pre-alpha version
of
Biblet](http://files.nothingisreal.com/software/biblet/biblet-prealpha.tar.bz2)
is available to download, as are the [slides from a Practical TeX 2005
talk on
Biblet](http://files.nothingisreal.com/software/biblet/biblet_slides.pdf).
