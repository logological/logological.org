# School newspapers

When I was in elementary school and high school, I published some school
newspapers with the help of my classmates. This page contains scans of
them.

*The Okie Dokie Journal*
------------------------

*The Okie Dokie Journal* was published from 1987 to 1988 by the Grade 4
class of Ethel Milliken School in Regina, Saskatchewan. There were at
least two issues. The *Journal* was designed by cutting and pasting
together material from various sources:

-   The covers, posters, and page headers were produced with *The Print
    Shop* or *Print Master* on an IBM-compatible and printed on a
    dot-matrix printer.
-   The article text was word-processed in *Pocket Writer 64* on a
    Commodore 64 and printed with a letter-quality DPS-1101 daisy-wheel
    printer.
-   The Garfield cartoon and the back cover of the first issue were
    produced with Doodle on a commodore 64 and printed with a
    Smith-Corona Fastext 80 printer.
-   Other illustrations were taken from magazine cuttings and printed
    clip art collections.

You can see scans of two issues by following the image links below.

*The Mini-Post*
---------------

*The Mini-Post* was published from 1988 to 1989 by the Grade 5 class of
Ethel Milliken School in Regina, Saskatchewan. There was at least one
issue. The journal was produced with a mish-mash of hand-drawing,
hand-lettering, and desktop publishing (including *The Newsroom*, *Bank
Street Writer*, and *Pocket Writer 64* on the Commodore 64, and desktop
publishing software for the Apple Macintosh 128K.) You can see a scan of
the first issue by following the image link below.

*And Now For Something Completely Different…*
---------------------------------------------

*And Now For Something Completely Different…* was published from 1995 to
1996 by the students of Campbell Collegiate in Regina, Saskatchewan.
There were at least three issues. The journal was produced using
WordPerfect on an IBM-compatible computer and printed on an Apple
LaserWriter. The three issues I have will be scanned and posted here
later.
