Why don't I have a girlfriend?
------------------------------

This is a question that practically every male has asked himself at one
point or another in his life. Unfortunately, there is rarely a hard and
fast answer to the query. Many men try to reason their way through the
dilemma nonetheless, often reaching a series of ridiculous explanations,
each more self-deprecating than the last: "Is it because I'm too shy,
and not aggressive enough? Is it my opening lines? Am I a boring person?
Am I too fat or too thin? Or am I simply ugly and completely
unattractive to women?" When all other plausible explanations have been
discounted, most fall back on the time-honoured conclusion that "there
must be Something Wrong™ with me" before resigning themselves to lives
of perpetual chastity.[^2]

Not the author, though. I, for one, refuse to spend my life brooding
over my lack of luck with women. While I'll be the first to admit that
my chances of ever entering into a meaningful relationship with someone
special are practically non-existent, I staunchly refuse to admit that
it has anything to do with some inherent problem with *me*. Instead, I
am convinced that the situation can be readily explained in purely
scientific terms, using nothing more than demographics and some
elementary statistical calculus.

Lest anyone suspect that my standards for women are too high, let me
allay those fears by enumerating in advance my three criteria for the
match. First, the potential girlfriend must be approximately my
age—let's say 21 plus or minus three or four years. Second, the girl
must be beautiful (and I use that term all-encompassingly to refer to
both inner and outer beauty). Third, she must also be reasonably
intelligent—she doesn't have to be *Mensa* material, but the ability to
carry on a witty, insightful argument would be nice. So there they
are—three simple demands, which I'm sure everyone will agree are
anything but unreasonable.

That said, I now present my demonstration of why the probability of
finding a suitable candidate fulfilling the three above-noted
requirements is so small as to be practically impossible—in other words,
why I will never have a girlfriend. I shall endeavour to make this proof
as rigorous as the available data permits. And I should note, too, that
there will be no statistical trickery involved here; I have cited all my
sources and provided all relevant calculations[^3] in case anyone wishes
to conduct their own independent review. Let's now take a look at the
figures.

Number of people on Earth (in 1998): 5 592 830 000[^4]
------------------------------------------------------

We start with the largest demographic in which I am interested—namely,
the population of this planet. That is not to say I'm against the idea
of interstellar romance, of course; I just don't assess the prospect of
finding myself a nice Altairian girl as statistically significant. Now
anyway, the latest halfway-reliable figures we have for Earth's
population come from the United States Census Bureau's 1999 *World
Population Profile* (*WP/98*). Due presumably to the time involved in
compiling and processing census statistics, said report's data is valid
only as of 1998, so later on we'll be making some impromptu adjustments
to bring the numbers up to date.

…who are female: 2 941 118 000[^5]
----------------------------------

I'd've thought that, given the title of this essay, this criterion goes
without saying. In case anyone missed it, though, I am looking for
exclusively *female* companionship. Accordingly, roughly half of the
Earth's population must be discounted. Sorry, guys.

…in "developed" countries: 605 601 000[^5]
------------------------------------------

We now further restrict the geographical area of interest to so-called
"first-world countries". My reasons for doing so are not motivated out
of contempt for those who are economically disadvantaged, but rather by
simple probability. My chances of meeting a babe from Bhutan or a
goddess from Ghana, either in person or on the Internet, are
understandably low. In fact, I will most likely spend nearly my entire
life living and working in North America, Europe, and Australia, so it
is to these types of regions that the numbers have been narrowed.

…currently (in 2000) aged 18 to 25: 65 399 083[^4][^5]
------------------------------------------------------

Being neither a pedophile nor a geriatrophile, I would like to restrict
my search for love to those whose age is approximately equal to my own.
This is where things get a bit tricky, for two reasons: first, the
census data is nearly two years old, and second, the "population by age"
tables in *WP/98* are not separated into individual ages but are instead
quantized into "15–19" (of whom there are 39 560 000) and "20–44"
(population 215 073 000). Women aged 15 to 19 in 1998 will be aged 17 to
21 in 2000; in this group, I'm interested in dating those 18 or older,
so, assuming the "15–19" girls' ages are uniformly distributed, we have
<div style="text-align:center">
$39\,560\,000 \times \frac{\left| 21 - 18 \right| + 1}{\left| 19 - 15
  \right| + 1} = 31\,648\,000.$

</div>
Similarly, of 1998's "20–44" category, there are now
<div style="text-align:center">
$215\,073\,000 \times \frac{\left| 25 - 22 \right| + 1}{\left| 44 - 20
  \right| + 1} = 34\,411\,680$
</div>
females within my chosen age limit. The sum, 66 059 680, represents the
total number of females aged 18 to 25 in developed countries in 2000.
Unfortunately, roughly 1% of these girls will have died since the census
was taken;[^6] thus, the true number of so-far eligible bachelorettes is
65 399 083.

…who are beautiful: 1 487 838
-----------------------------

Personal attraction, both physically and personality-wise, is an
important instigator of any relationship. Of course, beauty is a purely
subjective trait whose interpretation may vary from person to person.
Luckily it is not necessary for me to define beauty in this essay except
to state that for any given beholder, it will probably be normally
distributed amongst the population.[^7] Without going into the
specifics of precisely which traits I admire, I will say that for a girl
to be considered really beautiful to me, she should fall at least two
standard deviations above the norm. From basic statistics theory, the
area to the left of the normal curve at *z* = 2 is
<div style="text-align:center">
$\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \cdot \int_{0}^{2}
e^{-\frac{1}{2}z^2} dz~\approx~0.022\,75$
</div>
and so it is this number with which we multiply our current population
pool.

…and intelligent: 236 053
-------------------------

Again, intelligence can mean different things to different people, yet I
am once more relieved of making any explanation by noting that it, like
most other characteristics, has a notionally normal distribution across
the population. Let's assume that I will settle for someone a mere one
standard deviation above the normal; in that case, a further
<div style="text-align:center">
$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \cdot \int_{0}^{1}
e^{-\frac{1}{2}z^2} dz~\approx~84.1345\%$
</div>
of the population must be discounted.

…and not already committed: 118 027
-----------------------------------

I could find no hard statistics on the number of above-noted girls who
are already married, engaged, or otherwise committed to a significant
other, but informal observation and anecdotal evidence leads me to
believe that the proportion is somewhere around 50%. (Fellow unattached
males will no doubt have also noticed a preponderance of girls
legitimately offering, "Sorry, I already have a boyfriend" as an excuse
not to go on a date.) For reasons of morality (and perhaps too
self-preservation), I'm not about to start hitting on girls who have
husbands and boyfriends. Accordingly, that portion of the female
population must also be considered off-limits.

…and also might like me: 18 726
-------------------------------

Naturally, finding a suitable girl who I really like is no guarantee
that she'll like me back. Assuming, as previously mentioned, that
personal attractiveness is normally distributed, there is a mere 50%
chance that any given female will consider me even marginally
attractive. In practice, however, people are unlikely to consider
pursuing a relationship with someone whose looks and personality just
barely suffice. Let's make the rather conservative assumption, then,
that a girl would go out with someone if and only if they were at least
one standard deviation above her idea of average. In that case,
referring to our previous calculation, only 15.8655% of females would
consider someone with my physical characteristics and personality
acceptable as a potential romantic partner.

Conclusion
----------

It is here, at a pool of 18 726 acceptable females, that we end our
statistical analysis. At first glance, a datable population of 18 726
may not seem like such a low number, but consider this: assuming I were
to go on a blind date with a new girl about my age every week, I would
have to date for 3493 weeks before I found one of the 18 726. That's
very nearly 67 *years*. As a North American male born in the late 1970s,
my life expectancy is probably little more than 70 years, so we can
safely say that I will be quite dead before I find the proverbial girl
of my dreams. Come to think of it, she'll probably be dead too.

<hr style="margin-top:2em"/>
: *So there you have it, my friends—finally, a cogent, scientific,
    non-self-deprecating argument for why I will never have a
    girlfriend. That said, if you happen to be a girl deluded enough
    to think that you and I have a chance together, feel free to
    [drop me a line](/), but I warn you, you face odds of
    157 060 to 1. I wouldn't bother if I were you.*

: ***Update (2000-04-01):** My sarcastic pleas for some e-mail have
    finally been answered. Take a look at this
    [letter from a hysterical female reader](/fan_mail.html), which I
    think perfectly demonstrates the point of this entire essay.  (I
    think the fact that she's a WebTV user explains a lot—in fact, I
    was sure this e-mail was an April Fool's joke until I noticed the
    return address.)*

[^2]: After a short period of brooding, of course, these males will
    eventually come to the realization that the real reason they were
    never able to get a girlfriend is that they were too discriminating
    with their attentions. They will consequently return to the dating
    scene, entering a sequence of blasé relationships with mediocre
    girls for whom they don't really care, until they finally marry one
    out of fear of spending the rest of their lives alone. I am
    convinced that this behaviour is the real reason for today's
    alarmingly high divorce rate.

[^6]: *WP/98* gives the annual death rate for developed countries as 10
    per 1000, but does not list death rates per age group. Presumably,
    the death rate graphs as a bathtub curve, but in absence of any
    numbers supporting this hypothesis, and for the sake of simplicity,
    I will conservatively estimate the death rate among this age group
    to be 1% biennially.

[^7]: Despite my efforts to research the matter, I could find no data
    on the distribution of beauty, either outer or inner, amongst the
    population. Perhaps attractiveness, being a largely subjective
    trait, does not lend itself to quantification. It is not
    unreasonable, however, to assume that like most other traits, it has
    a normal distribution. Indeed, this assumption seems to be backed up
    by informal observation and judgment—in any reasonably large group
    of people, most of them will be average-looking, and a tiny minority
    either exceedingly beautiful or exceedingly ugly.
