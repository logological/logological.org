# Using Free Software at the University of Manitoba

Much of the officially supported productivity and groupware software the University of Manitoba provides for faculty and staff is proprietary.  If it does not work the way you want, then you may find that it is impossible to fix it or improve it yourself, or to get any help or cooperation from the developers.  However, in many cases it is possible to use [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) alternatives that suit your needs or that can be more easily improved.  This page aims to document these alternatives and provide some advice on choosing between them, configuring them, and running them.

## TLDR summary

For those who just want a quick overview of what to do:

* **MFA:** [Configure your MFA](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info) to use a phone number or security key instead of Microsoft's proprietary app.
* **E-mail:** Use [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) or any other OAuth2-capable e-mail clientâ€”see below for the correct IMAP and SMTP settings.  If your client doesn't support OAuth2, then install the [DavMail](https://davmail.sourceforge.net/) gateway and have the client connect to it.
* **Calendar:** Install the [DavMail](https://davmail.sourceforge.net/) gateway and have [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/), or any other CalDAV client, connect to it.
* **Address book:** Install the [DavMail](https://davmail.sourceforge.net/) gateway and have [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/), or any other CardDAV/LDAP client, connect to it.
* **Chat:** Use [Pidgin](https://www.pidgin.im/) and the appropriate plugins to access Teams, Slack, etc.
* **Digital signatures:** Use [XCA](https://www.hohnstaedt.de/xca/) to create a self-signed certificate and [Okular](https://okular.kde.org/) or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) to sign PDFs with it.
* **Office suite:** Microsoft 365 files can be downloaded for local editing with [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), and then uploaded again afterwards.

## Multi-factor authentication

Most of the University's online services require multi-factor authentication.  Step 1 of the University's [MFA set-up page](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info) instructs you to "download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app" for this purpose.  However, there is no need to install this proprietary app to use MFA!  You can instead jump straight to Step 4 and select a phone number or security key as your authentication method.

## E-mail

UM's e-mail system is hosted through a Microsoft Exchange server via Microsoft 365.  Fortunately, this service exposes standard IMAP and SMTP protocols for receiving and sending mail, respectively.  The protocols use Microsoft's so-called "Modern Authentication" (or OAuth2) mechanism, which many free mail clients do not (yet) support.  Clients that do support it include the following:

* [Alpine](https://alpineapp.email/)
* [Evolution](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/evolution/-/wikis/home)
* [FairEmail](https://email.faircode.eu/)
* [Mailspring](https://www.getmailspring.com/)
* [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/)

If your favourite e-mail client doesn't support OAuth2, you may be able to use it anyway with the help of an OAuth2 proxy such as [oauth2-proxy](https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy) or [DavMail](http://davmail.sourceforge.net/).  If you are using such a proxy, you will need to consult its documentation for how to configure it and your e-mail client.  (Tips on configuring DavMail are given elsewhere on this page.)

### Setting up incoming mail (IMAP)

For incoming mail, configure your e-mail client with the following settings.  (Note that the exact labels may vary from client to client.)

<dl>
<dt>Server type</dt>
<dd>IMAP</dd>
<dt>Server name</dt>
<dd>outlook.office365.com</dd>
<dt>Port</dt>
<dd>993</dd>
<dt>User name</dt>
<dd><em>Your.Email@umanitoba.ca</em></dd>
<dt>Connection security</dt>
<dd>SSL/TLS</dd>
<dt>Authentication method</dt>
<dd>OAuth2</dd>
</dl>

When you first configure your account, or when you check mail for the first time, your client will prompt you for multi-factor authentication.

### Setting up outgoing mail (SMTP)

For outgoing mail, configure your e-mail client with the following settings.  (Note that the exact labels may vary from client to client.)

<dl>
<dt>Server type</dt>
<dd>SMTP</dd>
<dt>Server name</dt>
<dd>smtp.office365.com</dd>
<dt>Port</dt>
<dd>587</dd>
<dt>User name</dt>
<dd><em>Your.Email@umanitoba.ca</em></dd>
<dt>Connection security</dt>
<dd>STARTTLS</dd>
<dt>Authentication method</dt>
<dd>OAuth2</dd>
</dl>

When you first configure your account, or when you send mail for the first time, your client will prompt you for multi-factor authentication.

### Junk mail filtering

Incoming mail that Microsoft deems to be suspicious will be automatically placed in an IMAP folder named "Junk mail".  You may not want this if you prefer to use your own spam filtering software, or if you prefer not to have your mail filtered at all.  Unfortunately, there is no way to fully disable the server-side filtering.  You can consider the following workarounds:

1. You can manage a list of "approved senders" through the Microsoft 365 web interface.  Mail from senders on this list will bypass the server-side junk mail checks.  The disadvantage of this method is that you have to manually manage the list (and of course that you have to do it through the proprietary web interface).

2. Your mail client may allow you to create a client-side filtering rule that automatically moves all incoming mail from the Junk mail folder to your inbox. Unfortunately, Thunderbird does not yet support filtering rules for mail arriving anywhere other than the inbox.

3. [Imap-CLI](https://github.com/Gentux/imap-cli) is a general-purpose command-line IMAP tool that you can configure to move all messages from one IMAP folder to another (say, from your "Junk mail" folder to your inbox).  You can then run it periodically (via a cron job, for example).  It supports OAuth2 authentication.

### Content rewriting

The mail server is configured to automatically add an obnoxious "**Caution!** This message was sent from outside the University of Manitoba." banner to the body of all incoming e-mails sent from outside the University.  There is no way to disable this.  You can consider the following workarounds:

1. The server doesn't rewrite the main body of signed and/or encrypted messages, though it will add to the message a new MIME part containing the banner.  So if it's important that the integrity of your incoming messages be preserved, you could encourage your correspondents to sign and/or encrypt their mails (e.g., with OpenPGP).

2. Your mail client may allow you to create a client-side filtering rule that automatically rewrites the body of incoming messages.  If so, you could create a filter that looks for and removes the banner.

## Calendar

The University has at least two calendar systems: a [public calendar system for events](https://eventscalendar.umanitoba.ca/), and another system that hosts the personal calendar associated with your umanitoba.ca e-mail account.

### Public events calendar

The [public calendar system for events](https://eventscalendar.umanitoba.ca/) can be used as-is with free software!  It provides event information via web pages that can be viewed in a web browser, via an RSS feed that can be viewed in a feed aggregator, or via iCalendar files that can be subscribed to from an HTTP- or WebDAV-capable calendar client such as [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/).

I recommend using the web interface to browse for event categories of interest to you.  (Follow the links in the drop-down menus near the top of the page.)  Once you are at the web page for a category, the "SUBSCRIBE" section in the right column of the page provides WebDAV or HTTP URLs that you can import into your calendar client:

1. For a WebDAV URL, click on the yellow Outlook icon.  This will open an "iCal Subscription" sidebar showing the URL for that category.  You can copy and paste this URL into your calendar client.
2. For an HTTP URL, click on the blue Google icon. This will open Google Calendar with an "Add calendar" dialog showing the URL for that category.  You can copy and paste this URL into your calendar client.

### Personal calendars

Personal calendars are hosted through a Microsoft Exchange server via Microsoft 365.  Unfortunately, it does not expose the standard CalDAV protocol, and most free calendar clients do not support Microsoft's proprietary protocols.  You can consider the following workarounds:

1. Install [DavMail](https://davmail.sourceforge.net/), a Java-based server that acts as a gateway between Microsoft's proprietary protocols and CalDAV.  You can then use any CalDAV-capable calendar client, such as [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/), and have it connect to your DavMail server.
2. Use [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/), which has an integrated calendar to which Microsoft Exchange support can be added via the [TbSync](https://addons.thunderbird.net/En-us/thunderbird/addon/tbsync/) and [Provider for Exchange ActiveSync](https://addons.thunderbird.net/En-us/thunderbird/addon/eas-4-tbsync/?src=ss) add-ons.  (Note that you must install _both_ add-ons.)

In my experience, both DavMail and TbSync are a bit buggy, which is inevitable considering that they aim to reverse-engineer a complex, largely undocumented, and constantly changing protocol.  However, their respective developers are very responsive to bug reports.  I find DavMail to be the more reliable and versatile of the two, though it is more complicated to set up than TbSync.

### Setting up DavMail

1. Download and install DavMail.  The author provides [prepackaged versions for Windows, Mac OS X, Debian, and other systems](https://davmail.sourceforge.net/download.html) on his website, and [prepackaged versions for CentOS, Fedora, and openSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3Amguessan%3Adavmail&package=davmail) via the openSUSE Build Service.
2. Configure the DavMail server.  To do this, go to the [DavMail website](https://davmail.sourceforge.net/) and follow the relevant setup instructions in the "DavMail setup" section of the navigation menu and in the "Office 365" and "Is Office 365 modern authentication / MFA supported?" sections of the [FAQ](https://davmail.sourceforge.net/faq.html).
3. Configure your calendar client.  To do this, go the [DavMail website](https://davmail.sourceforge.net/) and follow the relevant calendar setup instructions in the "Thunderbird Setup", "OS X Setup", "Android Setup", or "iPhone Setup" section of the navigation menu.  If you are using a different calendar client, you should be able to adapt the Thunderbird setup instructions.

On my openSUSE machines, I install DavMail using the repositories provided by the openSUSE Build Service.  (I add these repositories to Zypper so that any available upgrades to DavMail are fetched and installed whenever I do a system update using `zypper up` or `zypper dup`.)  I run DavMail as a headless systemd service in `O365Modern` mode, but to do the initial setup, I first ran it as a GUI application.  This allowed me to interactively perform the MFA and get the OAuth2 access token for use in the `davmail.properties` configuration file.

(At some point I may revise this section to include step-by-step instructions.)

## Address book

UM's address book is hosted through a Microsoft Exchange server via Microsoft 365.  Unfortunately, it does not expose the standard CardDAV or LDAP protocols, and most free e-mail/address book clients do not support Microsoft's proprietary protocols.  You can consider the following workarounds:

1. Install [DavMail](https://davmail.sourceforge.net/), a Java-based server that acts as a gateway between Microsoft's proprietary protocols and CardDAV or LDAP.  You can then use any CardDAV- or LDAP-capable client, such as [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/), and have it connect to your DavMail server.
2. Use [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/), which has an integrated address book to which Microsoft Exchange support can be added via the [TbSync](https://addons.thunderbird.net/En-us/thunderbird/addon/tbsync/) and [Provider for Exchange ActiveSync](https://addons.thunderbird.net/En-us/thunderbird/addon/eas-4-tbsync/?src=ss) add-ons.  (Note that you must install _both_ add-ons.)

You can set up DavMail for CardDAV/LDAP clients using instructions similar to those given above for CalDAV clients.

## Office suite

The Microsoft 365/Teams service used by the University includes an office suite, with browser-based versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  These online tools can export documents to OpenDocument format, which you can download and edit locally with free tools such as [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).  The online tools similarly allow documents to be uploaded and imported from OpenDocument format.

### Letterhead

The University provides [letterhead](https://umanitoba.sharepoint.com/sites/um-intranet-um-brand/SitePages/template-and-asset-library.aspx) in Microsoft Word and PDF formats.  The Word versions can be used with free word processors such as [LibreOffice Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/).  The author of this guide has produced a [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) version of the letterhead that he hopes to one day release here.

## Digital signatures

Various University offices will occasionally send you PDFs and ask you to digitally sign them.  There exist various free software tools that can sign PDFs with an existing PKCS#12 certificate:

1. [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) can sign PDFs with an existing certificate:
    1. Launch LibreOffice and select File â†’ Digital Signatures â†’ Sign Existing PDFâ€¦.  A file picker dialog will appear; select the PDF on your filesystem that you want to sign and press the "Open" button.  The PDF will open in a new window.  Press the "Sign Document" banner at the top of the window.  This will bring up a "Digital Signatures" dialog listing the document's current signatures.  Press the "Sign Documentâ€¦" button to select one of your existing signatures and sign the document.  If you haven't yet configured any signatures, you should first press the "Start Certificate Managerâ€¦" button, which will launch your system's default certificate management software.
2. [Okular](https://okular.kde.org/) can sign PDFs with an existing certificate:
    1. First, make sure that Okular is configured to use your existing certificate database: launch Okular and go to Settings â†’ Configure Backends.  In the setting dialog that appears, select "PDF".  If you don't see your certificate in the Available Certificates list, then you may need to specify the path to your certificate database by pressing the radio button next to "Custom" and then pressing the file picker icon or typing the path to the database file (e.g., `$HOME/.pki/nssdb`) in the input field.  Press "OK" when done.
    2. To actually sign a PDF, open it with Okular, scroll to the location in the document where you want the signature to appear, and select Tools â†’ Digitally Sign.  You will be prompted to draw a rectangle where you want the signature to appear on the page.  Then a dialog will appear prompting you to select a certificate to sign with, as well as a reason, location, and an image.  (Make sure you actually click on the desired certificate and the desired image, even if there is only one choice.)  Press "OK" and you will be prompted for where to save the signed version of the PDF.

If you don't yet have a PKCS#12 certificate, you will need to create one.  There are at least a couple options for this:

1. You can use the command-line tool [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).  (Instructions forthcoming.)
2. You can use the graphical [XCA](https://www.hohnstaedt.de/xca/) tool and the Mozilla NSS tools.  Here are some rough notes:
    1. Launch XCA.  Create a new database (File â†’ New DataBase).
    2. Start creating a new certificate by pressing the New Certificate button.  A new dialog window will pop up.
    3. In the "Signing" frame of the "Source" tab, select "Create a self signed certificate".
    4. In the "Subject" tab, enter an Internal Name to identify the certificate internally, and then fill in the fields in the "Distinguished name" frame.  The "countryName" should be a two-letter ISO code and the "commonName" should be your personal name.  Press "Generate a new key" to generate a private key.
    5. In the "Extensions" tab, set the Type to "Certification Authority".  If desired, adjust the validity period for the certificate.
    6. In the "Key usage" tab, check the "Critical" box in the "X509v3 Key Usage" frame.
    7. Press the OK button.  The dialog box disappears and the newly generated certificate now appears in the main window.
    8. Select the newly generated certificate and press the "Export" button.  An export dialog appears.
    9. Choose the name and filename, and set the Export Format to PKCS #12.
    10. Press the OK button.
    11. In a terminal, import the certificate into the PKI store: `pk12util -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -i /path/to/your/new/certificate.p12`

## Chat/team communication

The University's Microsoft 365 service includes Microsoft Teams, which can be used for chat and video conferencing.  There is no need to install Microsoft's proprietary Teams application in order to access Teams, as you can access Teams through a free web browser such as [Firefox](https://mozilla.org/firefox) or [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home).  However, note that the web interfaces themselves contain proprietary JavaScript, and accessing Teams through a standalone web browser may not be as convenient as using a dedicated application.  Some alternatives to consider:

1. Use [Pidgin](https://www.pidgin.im/), the universal chat client, with the [MS Teams Plugin](https://github.com/EionRobb/purple-teams).  This lacks support for certain features (calls, message reactions, etc.) but does support basic chat.  This solution is 100% free software.

2. Use [Ferdium](https://www.ferdium.org/), a desktop application that embeds web versions of various apps, including Teams.  It can do pretty much everything the web-based versions of Teams can do, but only because it runs the same proprietary JavaScript.

Individual academic units within the university may use Slack, another proprietary chat/team communication tool.  Both Pidgin (via [slack-libpurple](https://github.com/dylex/slack-libpurple)) and Ferdium support Slack as well, with the same respective advantages and disadvantages as their Teams support.
