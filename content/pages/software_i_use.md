title: Software I Use

# Software I use

## Operating system

I prefer to use Unix-like operating systems that
are [free software]().  I've dabbled with [Ubuntu]()
and [Mandrake Linux]() but for most of the past two decades I have
been using some flavour of [SuSE]() or [openSUSE]().  My main machine
runs **[openSUSE Tumbleweed]()** since I like having the latest
release of everything, and don't mind reporting bugs as I find them.
My other machines run **[openSUSE Leap]()**, which is a bit more
stable.

## Text editing

## Graphics editing

For bitmap graphics, I use **[Gimp]()**.  For vector graphics, I use
**[Inkscape]()** (formerly Sodipodi).

## "Office" stuff

## Development

For Java development, I use **[Eclipse]()**, but I'm not particularly
wedded to it; it just happens to be what most other people at work are
using.  For most other programming tasks I usually use **[Emacs]()**
(see above).

## E-mail

I was a long-term user of [KMail]() (since at least 2001) on my home
computer. When KMail2 came out, I held off on upgrading because of
several showstopping bugs I read about on the KDE Bugzilla.  Years and
years passed and these bugs didn't get fixed; meanwhile I was stuck
using an increasingly antiquated operating system (openSUSE 11.4, from
2012) since all newer versions of it packaged only KMail2.  In 2016
year I finally broke down and upgraded the OS to the most recent
version.

Predictably, KMail2 turned out to be a nightmare.  Converting my old
mail folders was fraught with problems.  When I finally got that
sorted out, I was bitten by an infamous message duplication bug
whereby extra copies of messages would appear whenever the filters
were run.  None of the workarounds from the dozen or so bug reports
worked for me.  I had no choice but to switch to another mail
client. Though I use Thunderbird at work (see below), its filtering
system is underpowered and buggy. I eventually settled
on **[Claws Mail]()**, which has a horribly clunky user interface, but at
least it is fast, has a powerful and highly configurable filtering
system, and doesn't eat my mail (very often).

At work I use **[Thunderbird]()** because it is one of the few clients
with support for my employer's Microsoft Exchange calendar (via the
**[Exchange EWS Provider]()** add-on).

## Web browser

Like most people who started browsing the Web in the mid-90s, my
preferred browser at the time was [Netscape Navigator]().  I stuck
with it when it was integrated into the [Netscape Communicator]()
suite, which was in turn released as free software as
the [Mozilla Application Suite](), and then renamed to
**[SeaMonkey]()**.  I continue to use SeaMonkey to this day.  The
standalone [Firefox]() web browser was also spun off from Mozilla, but
I don't use it because it is not as easily customizable as SeaMonkey,
because it has (to my tastes) an oversimplified user interface, and
because, at least in its early years, it was a massive resource hog.
Fortunately, SeaMonkey is compatible with most Firefox add-ons.  The
add-ons I use are **[uBlock Origin]()**, **[Greasemonkey]()**, and
**[HTTPS Everywhere]()**.

For occasional text-mode browsing, I use **[Links]()**, the smarter,
better-behaved cousin of the venerable [Lynx]().

## Media player

I play my music with **[Clementine]()**, a Qt-based player that forked
from [Amarok]() after its developers made an unpopular overhaul of its
user interface
and
[upgraded its database back-end in a way that trashed everyone's metadata]().

For audiobooks and video, I'm a long-time user of [MPlayer]() but have
recently been experimenting with **[MPV]()**, a fork that seems to
have more sensible design decisions.  For example, its command-line
options are named more saliently and more consistently, and it
automatically adjusts the audio pitch when speeding up playback.
