Title: Fun

# Fun

My interests in language, math, and computers were sparked and
strengthened by exposure to the works of
[Willard R. Espy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_R._Espy),
[Louis Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Phillips_%28author%29),
[Mike Keith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Keith_%28mathematician%29),
[Dmitri Borgmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Borgmann),
[Jim Butterfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Butterfield), and
others.  These writers share a great talent for making technical or
linguistic topics fun and accessible to a general audience.  This page
collects some of my own contributions to popular and recreational
mathematics and linguistics, plus a few other odds and ends.

## Logology

*[Logology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logology)*, or *recreational
linguistics*, is the study and practice of word games and wordplay.
Since 2012 I've been writing the Language Games column for
*[Babel: The Language Magazine](https://www.babelzine.com/)*, and was a
a regular contributor of language-themed articles and puzzles to
*[Lingo: The Language Magazine for Younger Readers](https://web.archive.org/web/20191206130309/http://www.lingozine.com/)*,
*[Games World of Puzzles](https://gamesworldofpuzzles.com/)*
(formerly *Games Magazine*),
*[Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics](https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/wordways/)*,
and other magazines.

* [Shakespeare's Sonnet Generator](https://logological.org/sonnet/),
    a website that randomly generates authentic Shakespearean sonnets
    (a collaboration with

## Recreational mathematics

These papers are mainly for fun, though some of them have some serious research content:

* [Why I will never have a girlfriend](/girlfriend.html) (published in *The Annals of Improbable Research*, 2002)

* [Knight-graphable words](https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5379&context=wordways) (with Mike Keith; published in *Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics*, February 2015)
* [A255436: Number of distinct, connected, order-*n* subgraphs of the infinite knight's graph](https://oeis.org/A255436) (published in *The On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences*, February 2015)
* [New puzzles on knight-graphable words](https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5405&context=wordways) (with Mike Keith; published in *Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics*, May 2015)
