Title: Fun

# Fun

My interests in language, math, and computers were sparked and
strengthened by exposure to the works of
[Willard R. Espy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_R._Espy),
[Louis Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Phillips_%28author%29),
[Mike Keith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Keith_%28mathematician%29),
[Dmitri Borgmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Borgmann),
[Jim Butterfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Butterfield), and
others.  These writers share a great talent for making technical or
linguistic topics fun and accessible to a general audience.  This page
collects some of my own contributions to popular and recreational
mathematics and linguistics, plus a few other odds and ends.

## Logology

*[Logology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logology)*, or *recreational
linguistics*, is the study and practice of word games and wordplay.
Since 2012 I've been writing the Language Games column for
*[Babel: The Language Magazine](http://www.babelzine.com/)*, and I am
a regular contributor of language-themed articles and puzzles to
*[Lingo: The Language Magazine for Younger Readers](http://www.lingozine.com/)*,
*[Games World of Puzzles](http://www.gamesmagazine-online.com/)*
(formerly *Games Magazine*),
*[Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics](http://www.wordways.com/)*,
and other magazines.

* [Shakespeare's Sonnet Generator](http://www.nothingisreal.com/sonnet/),
    a website that randomly generates authentic Shakespearean sonnets
    (a collaboration with
    [Dave Morice](http://www.amazon.com/Dave-Morice/e/B001K8LX2K/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_4?qid=1417181543&sr=8-4))

## Recreational mathematics

These papers are mainly for fun, though some of them have some serious research content:
